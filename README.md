# Constellation.js

A grid geometry toolkit for controlling 2D sprite motion.

Constellation manages 2D point grids and pathfinding navigation. The library is designed to control dynamic sprite motion within a 2D environment. Constellation expands upon the motion system used in the [What Makes You Tick?](http://lassiegames.com/games/wmyt "What Makes You Tick?") adventure game series. Features include:

 - Point and polygon grid management.
 - Pathfinding with [A-star](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm "A-star").
 - Polygon hit tests with [ray casting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon "Ray casting").
 - Snapping points to line segments.
 - Optimized nearest-point searching.
 - Dynamic point-to-point bridges via grid geometry.

For a grid builder demo, see [lassiegames.com/constellation](http://www.lassiegames.com/constellation "Constellation.js")

## Creating Animations

While Constellation is not an animation library itself, it's designed to work hand-in-hand with animation tools such as [jQuery](http://api.jquery.com/animate/ "jQuery Animation"), [TweenLite](http://www.greensock.com/gsap-js/ "TweenLite"), or [TweenJS](http://www.createjs.com/#!/TweenJS "TweenJS") (to name a few). Use Constellation to manage and search across grid geometry, then feed its points into your preferred animation library.

For example, here's jQuery used to animate a view from its current position to a mouse click, while bridging the start and end points through intervening grid geometry:

	// Setup a pilot view and a Constellation Grid:
	var $pilot = $("#pilot");
	var grid = ...Const.Grid...;

	$(document).click(function(evt) {
		// Parse out pilot's current coordinates:
		var px = parseInt($pilot.css('left').match(/\d+/g), 10);
		var py = parseInt($pilot.css('top').match(/\d+/g), 10);

		// Bridge a path across the grid between pilot view and mouse click:
		var path = grid.bridgePoints({x:px, y:py}, {x:evt.pageX, y:evt.pageY});

		// Queue all path motions:
		$.each(path, function(i, pt) {
			$pilot.animate({
				left: pt.x,
				top: pt.y
			});
		});
	});

Also, try using Constellation's angle methods to apply custom sprite graphics/animations to specific movement angles.

# API Documentation

## Const - Primitive objects

Constellation root namespace provides a collection of geometry primitives. Geometry primitives have no methods, therefore may be substituted by any object with common attributes.

**Const.Point** `var point = new Const.Point( x, y );`
Constellation point primitive. `Point` objects have the following properties:

- `x`: horizontal coordinate of the point.
- `y`: vertical coordinate of the point.

**Const.Rect** `var rect = new Const.Rect( x, y, width, height );`
Constellation rectangle primitive. `Rect` objects have the following properties:

- `x`: horizontal coordinate of the rectangle origin.
- `y`: vertical coordinate of the rectangle origin.
- `width`: rectangle width.
- `height`: rectangle height.

## Const - Static methods

Constellation root namespace also provides a collection of static geometry functions. All of these methods may be called directly on the `Const` namespace, and are passed simple arrays and/or Constellation primitives (`Point` & `Rect`).

**Const.distance** `var result = Const.distance( point1, point2 );`
Calculates the distance between two provided `Point` objects.

**Const.ccw** `var result = Const.ccw( pointA, pointB, pointC, exclusive? );`
Tests for counter-clockwise winding among three `Point` objects. Returns true if the three points trend in a counter-clockwise arc. Useful for intersection tests. Passing `true` for the optional `exclusive` param will pass balanced arcs.

**Const.intersect** `var result = Const.intersect( pointA, pointB, pointC, pointD );`
Tests for intersection between line segments AB and CD. Returns true if the line segments intersect.

**Const.degreesToRadians** `var radians = Const.degreesToRadians( degrees );`
Utility method for converting [degrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28angle%29 "Degrees") to [radians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radians").

**Const.radiansToDegrees** `var degrees = Const.radiansToDegrees( radians );`
Utility method for converting [radians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radians") to [degrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28angle%29 "Degrees").

**Const.angleRadians** `var radians = Const.angleRadians( pointA, pointB );`
Calculates the angle (in radians) between line segment AB and the [positive X-origin axis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_%28mathematics%29 "Origin axis"). Accepts two `Point` objects and returns the angle in [radians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian "Radians").

**Const.angleDegrees** `var degrees = Const.angleDegrees( pointA, pointB );`
Calculates the angle (in degrees) between line segment AB and the [positive X-origin axis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_%28mathematics%29 "Origin axis"). Accepts two `Point` objects and returns the angle in [degrees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_%28angle%29 "Degrees").

**Const.angleSector** `var degrees = Const.angleSector( radians, sectors?, offsetRadians? );`
Gets the [circular sector](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_sector "Circular Sector") index that an angle falls into. You may specify how many sectors to divide the circle into, and then plot an angle among those breaks. This is useful for applying orientation view states to a sprite while moving it around a grid; for example: given a sprite with 4 walk cycles for different orientations (left, front, right, back), use this method to select one of the four views based on the sprite's next angle of motion.

Requires an angle to be provided in radians. You may optionally specify the number of sectors to divide the circle into, the default is 8. Also accepts an optional offset (in radians) used to shift sector divisions off the [positive X-origin axis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_%28mathematics%29 "Origin axis"). By default, offset is configured as one-half of the sector size, which centers the X-origin axis within the first sector. Returns an index between `0` and `x-1`, where x is the number of sectors.

**Const.getRectForPointRing** `var result = Const.getRectForPointRing( [points] );`
Takes an array of `Point` objects; returns a `Rect` object of their bounding box.

**Const.hitTestRect** `var result = Const.hitTestRect( pointP, rect );`
Takes target point P and a `Rect` object; returns `true` if the point falls within the rectangle.

**Const.hitTestPointRing** `var result = Const.hitTestPointRing( pointP, [points, ...] );`
Takes a target point P and an array of points defining a ring. Returns true if P falls within the ring of points. Hit test is performed using [ray casting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_in_polygon "ray casting") method.

**Const.snapPointToLineSegment** `var result = Const.snapPointToLineSegment( pointP, pointA, pointB );`
Takes target point P, and snaps it to the nearest point along line segment AB.

**Const.getNearestPointToPoint** `var result = Const.getNearestPointToPoint( pointP, [points, ...] );`
Takes target point P and an array of points to search. Returns the nearest point to P within the array of points, using a simplified [nearest neighbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closest_pair_of_points_problem "Nearest neighbor") search.

## Const - Grid objects

Constellation `Grid` is a constructor function that must be instanced. A `Grid` object manages a collection of `Node` and `Polygon` objects.

**Const.Grid** `var grid = new Const.Grid( data? );`
Constructor for a new Constellation `Grid`. All grid operations must be invoked on a `Grid` instance.

**Const.Node** use... `grid.addNode();`
Constellation grid `Node` object; use a `Grid` instance to create and manage nodes. Nodes are just `Point` objects with additional attributes, therefore they may be used directly with any Constellation method that performs `Point` operations. `Node` objects have the following properties:

- `id`: unique identifier for the node. Don't touch this.
- `x`: horizontal coordinate of the node.
- `y`: vertical coordinate of the node.
- `to`: Table of connections to other nodes. Seriously, don't touch this.
- `data`: A data object of user-defined data attached to the node.

**Const.Polygon** use... `grid.addPolygon();`
Constellation grid `Polygon` object; use a `Grid` instance to create and manage polygons. Grid polygons have the following properties:

- `id`: unique identifier for the node. Don't touch this.
- `nodes`: Array of node ids defining the polygon ring.
- `data`: A data object of user-defined data attached to the polygon.

## Const - Grid methods

**grid.addNode** `grid.addNode( x, y, data? );` or `grid.addNode( data? );`
Adds a new `Node` object with specified X and Y coordinates, and an optional data object. Returns a reference to the new `Node` object. A data object may be provided as the sole parameter; if the data object contains an `id` property, that id will be assigned to the new node.

**grid.getNodeById** `grid.getNodeById( id );`
Gets a node by id reference. Returns a `Node` object, or `null` for missing ids.

**grid.getNodes** `grid.getNodes( id, ... );` or `grid.getNodes( [id, ...] );`
Gets one or more grid nodes by id reference, or maps an array of grid nodes to an array of ids. Returns an array of `Node` objects. Invalid ids return as `null`.

**grid.getNumNodes** `grid.getNumNodes();`
Specifies the number of nodes in the grid.

**grid.hasNodes** `grid.hasNodes( id, ... );` or `grid.hasNodes( [id, ...] );`
Tests if one or more node ids, or an array of node ids, exists within the grid.

**grid.joinNodes** `grid.joinNodes( id1, id2, ... );` or `grid.joinNodes( [id1, id2, ...] );`
Takes two or more node ids, or an array with two or more node ids, and joins them with connections. Returns `true` if changes are made.

**grid.splitNodes** `grid.splitNodes( id1, id2, ... );` or `grid.splitNodes( [id1, id2, ...] );`
Takes two or more node ids, or an array with two or more node ids, and splits apart their common connections. Returns `true` if changes are made.

**grid.detachNodes** `grid.detachNodes( id, ... );` or `grid.detachNodes( [id, ...] );`
Takes one or more node ids, or an array of node ids, and splits them from all of their respective connections. Returns `true` if changes are made.

**grid.removeNodes** `grid.removeNodes( id, ... );` or `grid.removeNodes( [id, ...] );`
Takes one or more node ids, or an array of node ids, detaches them from all connections, then removes them each from the grid. Any dependent polygons are also removed. Returns `true` if changes are made.

**grid.addPolygon** `grid.addPolygon( [node ids], data? );`
Takes an array of three or more node ids and creates a new `Polygon` object with the optional data object attached. Returns a reference to the new `Polygon` object.

**grid.getPolygonById** `grid.getPolygonById( id );`
Gets a polygon by id reference. Returns a `Polygon` object, or `null` for missing ids.

**grid.getPolygons** `grid.getPolygons( id, ... );` or `grid.getPolygons( [id, ...] );`
Gets one or more polygons by id reference, or maps an array of polygons to an array of ids. Returns an array of `Polygon` objects. Invalid ids return as `null`.

**grid.getNodesForPolygon** `grid.getNodesForPolygon( id );`
Takes a polygon id and returns an array of `Node` objects defining its polygon ring. Returns `null` if the specified polygon id is undefined.

**grid.getNumPolygons** `grid.getNumPolygons();`
Specifies the number of polygons in the grid.

**grid.removePolygons** `grid.removePolygons( id, ... );` or `grid.removePolygons( [id, ...] );`
Takes an array of polygon ids and removes them from the grid. All nodes defining the polygon rings are left intact. Pass `true` as the optional second argument to perform changes silently without triggering an update event. Returns `true` if changes are made.

**grid.findPath** `grid.findPath( startId, goalId, weightFunction?, estimateFunction? );`
Takes two node ids defining start and goal nodes, then finds the shortest path between them. By default, routing favors the shortest path based on coordinate geometry. However, you may customize path routing using the optional weight and estimate functions:

 - `weightFunction`: `function( startNode, currentNode ) { return numericCost; }`
This function is used to calculate the weight (or cost) of each new grid segment added to a path. The function is provided two `Node` objects as arguments, and expects a numeric segment weight to be returned. The pathfinder returns a path that accrues the lowest total weight. By default, `Const.distance` is used to measure the weight of each segment.

 - `estimateFunction`: `function( currentNode, goalNode ) { return numericEstimate; }`
This function optimizes search performance by providing a best-case scenario estimate for each node's cost to reach the goal. This function is provided two `Node` objects as arguments: the current search node, and the goal node. An estimated cost-to-goal value should be returned. By default, `Const.distance` is used to estimate the best-case distance from a working path to the goal.

**grid.findPathWithFewestNodes** `grid.findPathWithFewestNodes( startId, goalId );`
Convenience method for running `grid.findPath` configured to find a path to goal using the fewest node connections rather than the shortest distance.

**grid.snapPointToGrid** `grid.snapPointToGrid( point );`
Snaps the provided point to the nearest position among all joined line segments within the node grid. The snapped point will be plotted at the nearest available line segment, or the nearest grid point if no line segments are defined. Returns a meta object with the following attributes:

 - `point`: the snapped `Point` object.
 - `offset`: the snapped offset distance from the original point.
 - `segment`: an array of node ids defining the line segment on which the point was snapped.

**grid.bridgePoints** `grid.bridgePoints( startPt, goalPt, confineToGrid? );`
*This algorithm is in progress. Current pathing results may be erratic.*

Creates a grid path bridging between two `Point` objects that are not connected to the grid. This is a composite operation intended to take two dynamic input locations, and intelligently connect them through the existing grid structure. The steps of this algorithm operate as follows:

* Test if start and goal are contained within a common polygon; if so, return a direction-connection array between them.
* (...not yet implemented...) Test if points fall within adjacent polygons.
* Dynamically join `start` and `goal` points into the grid, then run pathfinder. Dynamic point inclusion uses:
    * If `start` or `goal` points fall within a polygon, then that point connects through their encompassing polygon node ring.
    * Otherwise, `start` and `goal` points will connect through tether nodes snapped into to the grid.

The `bridgePoints` method will always return an array of point objects starting with the originally specified `startPt`. The array will also contain additional path positions, and finally the `goalPt`. Optionally, you may specify `confineToGrid`, at which time the `goalPt` will be adjusted to either fall within a polygon area or snap to a grid line.

**grid.getNearestNodeToPoint** `grid.getNearestNodeToPoint( point );`
Finds and returns the closest grid `Node` object to the specified `Point` position. Performs an optimized (sorted) search.

**grid.getNearestNodeToNode** `grid.getNearestNodeToNode( id );`
Finds the next closest grid node to the specified node id. Similar to `getNearestNodeToPoint`, except that the input is a node id rather than a `Point` object.

**grid.hitTestPointInPolygons** `grid.hitTestPointInPolygons( point );`
Returns true if the provided `Point` intersects any `Polygon` objects within the grid.

**grid.getPolygonHitsForPoint** `grid.getPolygonHitsForPoint( point );`
Tests a `Point` object for intersections with all `Polygon` objects in the grid, then returns an array of polygon ids that encompass the point.

**grid.getNodesInPolygon** `grid.getNodesInPolygon( id );`
Takes a polygon id and tests it for intersections with all nodes in the grid, then returns an array of the contained node ids. Nodes that compose the polygon's ring will be included in the returned array, even though their edge positions may fail a mathematical hit test.

**grid.getNodesInRect** `grid.getNodesInRect( rect );`
Tests a `Rect` object for intersections with all nodes in the grid, and returns an array of the contained node ids.

## Const.utils

Constellation includes implementations of several common collection management functions for working with arrays and objects. These are very similar to [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/ "Underscore.js") methods, although their implementations may vary.

**Const.utils.size** `Const.utils.size( object );`
Counts the number of items in an array, or the number of properties on an object.

**Const.utils.contains** `Const.utils.contains( object, value );`
Accepts an array or object and a value to search for. Returns true if an array contains the provided value, or an object defines a key for the specified value.

**Const.utils.each** `Const.utils.each( object, iteratorFunction, context? );`
Iterates an array or object with the provided function. Iterator is passed `( value, index )` for arrays, and `( value, key )` for objects. An optional scope context may be provided in which to run the interator.

**Const.utils.map** `Const.utils.map( object, mutatorFunction, context? );`
Iterates an array or object with the provided mutator function. Mutator is passed each `value`, and returns a modified value to replace the original within the collection. An optional scope context may be provided in which to run the interator.

**Const.utils.all** `Const.utils.all( array, testFunction, context? );`
Iterates through the provided array and performs a test function on each value. Returns true if all values pass the test.

# Data Graphs

While Constellation is designed to manage 2D coordinate geometry, it also provides support for managing node-based data graphs that can be searched using a-star. For example, let's set up a simple social graph using Constellation's node data API:

	// Create a social graph with "mom", "sister", "brother", and a "friend":
	var grid = new Const.Grid();
	grid.addNode({id:'mom', age:50});
	grid.addNode({id:'sister', age:16});
	grid.addNode({id:'brother', age:14});
	grid.addNode({id:'friend', age:14});

	// Create two social rings:
	grid.joinNodes('mom', 'sister', 'brother');
	grid.joinNodes('mom', 'brother', 'friend');

In the above example, we have a node graph defined by data attributes with no coordinates. Then using the *weight* and *estimate* functions provided by the Constellation grid's A-star pathfinder, we can configure an intelligent search to navigate the graph via data attributes. For example, let's map a path between `"sister"` and `"friend"` nodes while adhering to the lowest net age:

	var weightFunct = function(last, current) {
		return last.data.age + current.data.age;
	};

	var estimateFunct = function(current, goal) {
		return goal.data.age;
	};

	var path = grid.findPath('sister', 'friend', weightFunct, estimateFunct);
	// result array: ["sister" > "brother" > "friend"]

The above process works by replacing Constellation's default *weight* and *estimate* functions. A weight function measures the accrued cost of each new grid segment, while the estimate function measures a best-case cost for reaching the goal. By default, Constellation uses its geometry `distance` function to measure the cost of grid segments. However, you're welcome to override this process and measure grid searches against custom meta data.
